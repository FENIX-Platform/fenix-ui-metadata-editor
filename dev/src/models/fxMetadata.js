Data for cities over 100,000 residents for 38 countries have collected; for the other 16 countries the choice was to collect data for cities over 50,000 residents. The following variables have been considered for the data collection: Country code (according to GAUL 2006/2007), ISO3 code, Country name (according to GAUL 2006/2007), City code (ISO3 code + progressive number by alphabetical order), City name, Latitude and longitude, Calculated population for the year 2008, Last Census available, Last Census year, Alternative city name (alternate spellings or anglicized or local names according GEOnet Names Server (GNS). Data Sources: UN Statistics Division, that provides population for cities and agglomerations of over 100,000 and capital cities; UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, that provides population figures of largest agglomeration in each country; National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) with GEOnet Names Server (GNS), that provides the location (latitude and longitude) and the alternative names of the cities; World Gazetteer, that provides population figures for 23 countries and 2008 population calculation for all the cities of all the countries; City Population that provides population figures for 30 countries. The database provides the location and the population figures of the main cities of the African countries listed in the enclosed Appendix I.",
