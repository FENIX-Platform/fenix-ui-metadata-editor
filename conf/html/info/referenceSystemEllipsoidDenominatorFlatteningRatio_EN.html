    <h3>Denominator Of Flattening Rate Description</h3>
    <table><tr><td>Ratio between the semi-major axis and the semi-minor axis of an ellipse. Generally an ellipse is completely
        specified by the measure of the semi-major axis 'a' and the measure of the semi-minor axis 'b'. In
        practice geodesy the shape of an ellipse is specified through the inverse flattening, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>&fnof;</sub> where &fnof; =  <sup>(a-b)</sup>&frasl;<sub>a</sub>
