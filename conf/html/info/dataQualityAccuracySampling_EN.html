    <h3>Accuracy - sampling error</h3>
    <table><tr><td>If probability sampling is used, the accuracy is an evaluation of dierence between a population value and
        an estimate therof, derived from a random sample (so due to the fact that only a subset of the population
        is enumerate), normally in the form of coefficient of variation, standard error or confidence intervals. For
        non-probability sampling, random errors cannot be calculated without reference to some kind of model,
        in this case estimates of the accuracy, a motivation for the invoked model for this estimation and brief
        discussion of sampling bias should be provided.</td></tr></table>
