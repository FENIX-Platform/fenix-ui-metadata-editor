    <h3>Data Quality Accuracy</h3>
    <table><tr><td>Closeness of computations or estimates to the exact values that the statistics
        were intended to measure. Accuracy can contain either measures of numerical results of the methods for
        assessing the accuracy of data or qualitative assessment indicators. It may also be described in terms
        of the major sources of error that potentially cause inaccuracy (e.g. sampling, non-response, response
        error).</td></tr></table>
