    <h3>Datum Description</h3>
    <table><tr><td>Identifier of the datum used. Datum description is requested when the coordinate reference system
        citation is not supplied. A datum could be geodetic, vertical or engineering. A geodetic datum gives the
        relationship of a coordinate system to the Earth and is used as the basis for two or three dimensional
        system (in most cases it requires an ellipsoid definition). A vertical datum gives the relationship of
        gravity-related heights to a surface known as the geoid. A datum can be engineering if it is neither
        geodetic not vertical. For geodetic datum it could be useful to report the EPGS (European Petroleum
        Survey Group) coordinates.</td></tr></table>
